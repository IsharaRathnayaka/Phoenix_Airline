INTRODUCTION
Airlines managing system is a system that helps with flight management, ticket management, and user management while allowing for direct communication with the user, staff, and administrators.

•	Users can log into their account once they are registered with the database
•	Members of Grade 1 staff are responsible for updating and deleting the flight information as well as updating and deleting tickets.
